This is mostly a pet project to learn me some Rust. My goal is to make
a dice roller for the One Ring, 2nd edition, the roleplaying game
published by FreeLeague.

Itâ€™s not usuable right now, anyway my goals are to:

- make a shell to roll dice pools
- benchmark dice pools results to get empirical probabilities
- have a nice lib which could be used in other programms

So far I really enjoy programming in Rust.
