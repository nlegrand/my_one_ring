This is mostly a pet project to learn me some Rust. My goal is to make
a dice roller for [[https://freeleaguepublishing.com/en/games/the-one-ring/][the One Ring™]], 2nd edition, the roleplaying game
published by [[https://freeleaguepublishing.com/][Free League]]. It's very unofficial and made for my own
fun.

My goals are to:

- [X] make dice rolls from shell
- [X] benchmark dice pools results to simulate outcomes probabilities
- [ ] have a nice lib which could be used in other programms

So far I really enjoy programming in Rust.

* Installation

#+begin_src shell
$ git clone https://github.com/nlegrand/my_one_ring.git
$ cd my_one_ring
$ cargo build
$ cargo install --path .
#+end_src

* Usage

#+begin_src shell
$ my_one_ring --help    
Usage: my_one_ring [OPTIONS] --success-dice <DICE>

Options:
  -s, --success-dice <DICE>  How many success dice
  -f, --favoured             The roll is favoured
  -i, --ill-favoured         The roll is ill-favoured
  -w, --weary                The character is weary
  -m, --miserable            The character is miserable
      --simulation           Simulate four million roll
  -h, --help                 Print help
  -V, --version              Print version

* Examples

** Some rolls

#+begin_src shell
  $ my_one_ring --success-dice 3
  Feat dice: 2
  Success dice: 1, 1, 4.
  The result is 8 with 0 success(es)

  $ my_one_ring --success-dice 3 --favoured
  Feat dice (Favoured): 8, 4
  Success dice: 3, 4, 5.
  The result is 20 with 0 success(es)

  $ my_one_ring --success-dice 3 --ill-favoured --weary
  Condition: weary
  Feat dice (Ill favoured): 4, 3
  Success dice: 1, 2, 6 (Success icon).
  The result is 9 with 1 success(es)

  $ my_one_ring --success-dice 6 --ill-favoured --weary --miserable
  Condition: weary
  Condition: miserable
  Feat dice (Ill favoured): Eye of Sauron, 3
  Success dice: 1, 5, 6 (Success icon), 2, 1, 6 (Success icon).
  Automatic failure!!!
  The result is 17 with 2 success(es)
