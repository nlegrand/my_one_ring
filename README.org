This is mostly a pet project to learn me some Rust. My goal is to make
a dice roller for [[https://freeleaguepublishing.com/en/games/the-one-ring/][the One Ringâ„¢]], 2nd edition, the roleplaying game
published by [[https://freeleaguepublishing.com/][Free League]]. It's very unofficial and made for my own
fun.

My goals are to:

- [X] make dice rolls from shell
- [ ] benchmark dice pools results to simulate outcomes probabilities
- [ ] have a nice lib which could be used in other programms

So far I really enjoy programming in Rust.
